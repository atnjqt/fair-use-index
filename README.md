## Getting Started

Fair Use Index data copied manually from the [US Govt Copyright Office Fair Use Index](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/fair-index.html) on February 24th, 2025.
- Excel data file: [USGOVT_FairUseIndex_02-24-2025.xlsx](USGOVT_FairUseIndex_02-24-2025.xlsx)
- Consists of **6 Columns** available for **250 rows**: 
    - `Index(['Case', 'Year', 'Court', 'Jurisdiction', 'Categories', 'Outcome'], dtype='object')`

### Data Distribution



### Code Dependencies

**Python 3.11** is required to run the code in the [analysis.ipynb](analysis.ipynb) notebook with the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install openpyxl
```

### Data Analysis

This analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook with Python 3.11, using the index data to understand the distribution of the US Govt referenced cases across the years (decades), courts, jurisdictions, categories, and outcomes. 

Steps are taken to visualize the data for summarization of the US Govt Fair Use Index over time, in support of my graduate course work for LAW-9580 Cybercrime at Penn Carey Law.
